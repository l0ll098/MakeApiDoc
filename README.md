# MakeApiDoc
This minimalistic tool allows you to build documentation for your APIs and save it as a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file

# Usage
Just open this [Demo](https://l0ll098.github.io/MakeApiDoc/MakeApiDoc.html) and play with it!

When you have finished, press the "Save" button (at the end of the page) and your doc will be generated and downloaded

**Warning!**
This page will work only when you are connected to the Internet as it depends on AngularJS CDN
